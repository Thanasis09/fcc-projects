                            Alexander III of Macedon, commonly known as Alexander the Great,
                            was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon.
                            He succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20,
                            and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia and Egypt.
                            By the age of 30, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to northwestern India.
                            He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of history's greatest and most successful military commanders.

                    <p class="birth">
                        He was born in Pella, the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon. The day he was born, Phillip (his father) had been preparing a siege on the city of
                        Potidea. The same day, Phillip received news that Illyrian and Paeonian armies had been defeated by his armies, and that
                        his horses had won the Olympic Games.
                    </p>
                    <p class="education">
                        When he was 13, his father chose Aristotle as Alexander's tutor. Aristotle taught Alexander about
                        medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic and art. Alexander developed a passion about Homer's works, and in particular Illiad.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ascent">
                        In <em>336 BC</em>, while Phillip was attending the wedding of his daughter, Cleopatra, he was killed by the captain of his bodyguards, Pausanias.
                        Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and the army, at just the age of 20.
                    </p>
                    <p class="reign">
                        During his reign, he conquered the entire Persian Empire, thus dissintegrating it. The four most famous battles of him are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Battle of Issus</li>
